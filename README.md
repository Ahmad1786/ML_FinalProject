# Final Project for Machine Learning CS07455 at Rowan University

Notebooks are numbered to denote order of progression in project. 

## 1. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
   Covers data exploration and cleaning.
## 2. Initial Modeling
   Covers running initial modeling on a 80/20 train-test split
## 3. Learning Curves
   Covers making learning curves of the inital models to look into underfitting and overfitting.
## 4. Improving Models
   Final Notebook covering improving models through hyperparameter tuning.

There are some comments and discussion in the notebooks but they are mostly for the code itself. The actual full explanations and commentary for the project is found in the final report which is the main thing. 

## Some additional files:

ML Project Final Report.pdf is the aforementioned final report (most important file!) 

RawDataReport.html is the Pandas Profiling Report that was very important in the EDA phase.

raw_data.csv is the original raw data set obtained from kaggle and clean_data.csv is the cleaned dataset that was used in modeling after EDA.

best_params.txt just documents the best parameters found for each of the models found in the "Improving Models" notebook.
